# Aerofly RC7 Scenery
Aerofly RC7 scenery of the airfield from the Burgfalken Urbach e.V. model aeroclub with some basic features. 

## Usage

### OSX

Up to now, no collision objects are added (trees, hut, ...) and the direction of the landing field is not exactly the direction of the real landing field.
